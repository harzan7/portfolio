                    During this time at Excellus, I gained insight into the development process of mobile apps.
                    I had the opportunity to gain experience on creating potential features for the Excellus apps,
                    like a dynamic background depending on the user location, and the time-sensitive welcome messages.
                    I also laid the foundation and successfully created a feature that would go live,
                    which is the In-App Messaging and Push Notifications feature using Firebase.

                    During my first co-op at Excellus, I gained insight into how automated testing is done on the UI side.
                    For most of my co-op, I created automated testing scripts for sites that would replicate human interaction (like clicking buttons, filling out forms, etc.),
                    in order to make sure that the functions on the webpage works as expected.
                    Toward the end, I created scripts that would automatically correct EDI files (files that contain healthcare information about clients),
                    so that no errors are detected when they are processed by the automatic error-checking system.
